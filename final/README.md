### Overall
- Using Google Cloud Platform to publicly host a reachable chatbot
  - accessible with a UI browser-based frontend or as an API request for backends
- Utilizes flask with Gemini integration
- Codebase Extras...
  - a locally working discord bot version of the chatbot
  - screenshots of working examples
  - using bootstrap for nicer UI
  - there does seem to be some context issues with Gemini, probably because all the text it gets to process at once. fairly unavoidable
  - Discord...
    - "discord_bot.py" must be running locally and have the bot imported. Screenshots shown to verify the code (as running locally is a pain)
